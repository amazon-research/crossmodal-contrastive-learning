0004_Charade_00.17.03.437-00.17.10.665	00.17.03.437	00.17.10.665	00.17.03.437	00.17.10.665	Then, suddenly, in rapid succession, he sneezes six times.
0004_Charade_00.17.16.956-00.17.18.028	00.17.16.956	00.17.18.028	00.17.16.492	00.17.18.492	He takes a small bottle from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.

0004_Charade_00.17.37.566-00.17.38.276	00.17.37.566	00.17.38.276	00.17.36.921	00.17.38.921	He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a bright yellow flower in his lapel.

0004_Charade_00.17.39.639-00.17.40.666	00.17.39.639	00.17.40.666	00.17.39.153	00.17.41.153	He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING him, and we notice his unsteady gait.
0004_Charade_00.17.40.834-00.17.42.427	00.17.40.834	00.17.42.427	00.17.40.631	00.17.42.631	He turns to look at the others present.

0004_Charade_00.18.03.148-00.18.08.601	00.18.03.148	00.18.08.601	00.18.03.148	00.18.08.601	Then he takes the flower from his lapel and throws it into the open box.
0004_Charade_00.18.14.419-00.18.15.090	00.18.14.419	00.18.15.090	00.18.13.755	00.18.15.755	SOMEONE points to SOMEONE.

0004_Charade_00.19.17.006-00.19.20.843	00.19.17.006	00.19.20.843	00.19.17.006	00.19.20.843	She pulls out the letter and starts to read it.
0004_Charade_00.19.21.080-00.19.22.654	00.19.21.080	00.19.22.654	00.19.20.867	00.19.22.867	It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead and the typed message reads.
0004_Charade_00.19.30.377-00.19.30.489	00.19.30.377	00.19.30.489	00.19.29.433	00.19.31.433	SOMEONE has been reading over SOMEONE's shoulder.

0004_Charade_00.19.57.364-00.19.58.999	00.19.57.364	00.19.58.999	00.19.57.182	00.19.59.182	The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk is covered with its plastic shroud.
0004_Charade_00.19.59.142-00.20.03.725	00.19.59.142	00.20.03.725	00.19.59.142	00.20.03.725	SOMEONE enters, looks for somebody, notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar.

0004_Charade_00.20.11.363-00.20.14.784	00.20.11.363	00.20.14.784	00.20.11.363	00.20.14.784	He wears heavy tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion.
